# PAMELA-DEV
PAMELA is a novel generic collaborative open-source MAS framework that aims at being light, beginner-friendly, and that allows for fast prototyping through assisted scenario generation and powerful configuration. The tool can work with or without (for faster simulations) the integrated graphical user interface (designed for both testing and visualization). To make is more attractive to new programmers and to enable an easier interfacing with trending machine learning frameworks, PAMELA is entirely written in Python and only relies on standard libraries. 

## Instalation
1. Clone this repository
2. In terminal install depence : "pip -r requirment.txt"
3. run pamela.py after adapt configuration

## prerequisites
Using pamela is very simple. The "Agent" class can be specified or you can use the generic "StandardAgent" class.
You must know the basics of multi-agent systems : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system

## Scenario and setup.
Pamela has a configuration wizard.

However, if you are comfortable with json files, it will be easier to use the files proposed in the scenario folder.
